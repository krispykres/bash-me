<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> Hello! My name is Ian Kresyman and I am a 4th year TAM student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I have lived in Colorado my whole life and love the hiking, mountain biking, and snowboarding. Something interesting is I studied in Australia for a semester and got to explore the land down under.</p>
<h2> Web Experience </h2>
<p> I took a web class my last semester so I am pretty familar with HTML5 markup, CSS and some JavaScript. I hope to learn a lot this semester becuase web technology is really fun to me. </p>
<h2> Takeaways </h2>
<p> This semster I hope to learn anything beyond my basic markup expertise. Besides JS, there is a lot more a web developer can do to enhance their websites, so I hope to be more well versed in several more aspects of web development after this class. </p>
